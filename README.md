# Large Scale Data Processing: Project 1
## Getting started
Head to [Project 1](https://github.com/CSCI3390/project_1) if you're looking for information on Git, template repositories, or setting up your local/remote environments.

## Resilient distributed datasets in Spark
This project will familiarize you with RDD manipulations by implementing some of the sketching algorithms the course has covered thus far.  

You have been provided with the program's skeleton, which consists of 5 functions for computing either F0 or F2: the BJKST, tidemark, tug-of-war, exact F0, and exact F2 algorithms. The tidemark and exact F0 functions are given for your reference.

## Relevant data

The file `2014to2017.csv` contains the records of parking tickets issued in New York City from 2014 to 2017. You'll see that the data has been cleaned so that only the license plate information remains. Keep in mind that a single car can receive multiple tickets within that period and therefore appear in multiple records.  

**Hint**: while implementing the functions, it may be helpful to copy 100 records or so to a new file and use that file for faster testing.  

## Calculating and reporting your findings


## Submission via GitHub
Delete your project's current **README.md** file (the one you're reading right now) and include your report as a new **README.md** file in the project root directory. Have no fearâ€”the README with the project description is always available for reading in the template repository you created your repository from. For more information on READMEs, feel free to visit [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes) in the GitHub Docs. You'll be writing in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown). Be sure that your repository is up to date and you have pushed all changes you've made to the project's code. When you're ready to submit, simply provide the link to your repository in the Canvas assignment's submission.

## You must do the following to receive full credit:
1. Create your report in the ``README.md`` and push it to your repo.
2. In the report, you must include your (and your partner's) full name in addition to any collaborators.
3. Submit a link to your repo in the Canvas assignment.

## Late submission penalties
Beginning with the minute after the deadline, your submission will be docked a full letter grade (10%) for every 
day that it is late. For example, if the assignment is due at 11:59 PM EST on Friday and you submit at 3:00 AM EST on Sunday,
then you will be docked 20% and the maximum grade you could receive on that assignment is an 80%. 
Late penalties are calculated from the last commit in the Git log.
**If you make a commit more than 48 hours after the deadline, you will receive a 0.**
